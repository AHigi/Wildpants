# Wildpants :jeans:
Wildpants is the core engine behind Bagnon and Bagnonium. Having a shared codebase allows for easier maintenance and for new features to be simultaneously implemented on both addons without additional effort.

It **is not a library to be reused to implement other addons**, as it constitutes the vast majority of what these addons are. Bagnon and Bagnonium are just two different skins implemented over the engine.


## For Developers
